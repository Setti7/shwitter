## Database migrations

We are using [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/) to manage the database migrations.
If you don't have it installed already, please go to [here](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) and follow the installation steps.

See makefile for common commands. TODO: write about using this pkg as a CLI and setting up the enviroment.
